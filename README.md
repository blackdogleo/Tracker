# Tracker
Tracker is a python program which captures image of user on system startup and creates a log file (time as entry).

Right now main file(cv_check.py) can capture image and create a log file(current time as entry)

In order to make it work on startup , just put it in Startup folder (windows) -> (win key +  r -- then type shell:startup)
